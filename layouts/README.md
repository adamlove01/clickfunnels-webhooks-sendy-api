# LAYOUTS

## default.vue

This file is a special NUXT component. If it's defined, all pages in the /pages folder will inherit it. It includes the Nav and App Bar for desktop and mobile views. 

There is quite a bit of SCSS styling to get the nav and menus to work properly at all screen widths. This is pretty typical for a site in production. The default nav never does what you want it to...

## error.vue

This file is a special NUXT component. This custom error page displays any 404 (not found), 401 (not authorized) and unknown (probably code) errors.
