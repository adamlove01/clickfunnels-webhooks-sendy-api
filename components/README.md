# COMPONENTS

We are using the Vuetify component library in this project so most of our components are from Vuetify -- we do not need a lot of custom components. Vuetify was installed using Vue CLI. We did not use the Nuxt Vuetify module because this is locked at a lower version. We wanted the latest version of Vuetify for our project.

## PageTitle.vue
A title component for logged-in pages.

## section/Hero.vue
A full-width image section with hero title.

## section/Benefits.vue
A landing page section showing a series of cards.

## section/Technology.vue
A landing page section showing a series of cards with links.

Note that we have enabled @nuxt/components by `npm install @nuxt/components` and setting `components: true` in nuxt.config.js which allows us to include custom components on a .vue page without needing to manually import them in the code.
